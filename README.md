# FRODO
This repo contains materials for "FRODO: a novel approach to micro-macro multilevel regression".

**Documentation**

Contains the manuscript/thesis chapter for FRODO (under construction).

**Code**

Contains the main R functions required to use FRODO (`frodo_functions.R`), as well as the main FRODO program (`frodo.stan`) and an extension which allows for a group-level scalar covariate
(`frodo_with_scalar.stan`). See the various demo files for examples. Note that there are also several Stan corresponding to scalar models used for comparisons in the
demos (see Sections 4-5 of the manuscript).
